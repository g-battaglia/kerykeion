    Factory for creating house comparison analyses between two astrological subjects.

    Analyzes placement of astrological points from one subject within the house system
    of another subject, performing bidirectional analysis for synastry studies and
    subject comparisons. Supports both natal subjects and planetary return subjects.

    Attributes:
        first_subject: First astrological subject (natal or return subject)
        second_subject: Second astrological subject (natal or return subject)
        active_points: List of astrological points to include in analysis

    Example:
        >>> natal_chart = AstrologicalSubjectFactory.from_birth_data(
        ...     "Person A", 1990, 5, 15, 10, 30, "Rome", "IT"
