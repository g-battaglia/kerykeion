House Comparison Utilities

Utility functions for calculating house placement relationships between astrological subjects.
Provides core calculation logic for determining where points from one subject fall within
another subject's house system.

    """
    Calculate house placements of one subject's points within another subject's house system.

    Analyzes where each astrological point from the point_subject falls within the
    house structure of the house_subject. Creates detailed mapping including both
    the point's original house position and its projected house placement.

    Args:
        point_subject: Subject whose astrological points are being analyzed
        house_subject: Subject whose house system provides the projection framework
        active_points: List of astrological points to include in the analysis.
                      Defaults to standard active points configuration.

    Returns:
        list[PointInHouseModel]: List of point placement models containing detailed
                                information about each point's house relationships,
                                including original and projected house positions.

    Note:
        Only processes points that exist in both the point_subject's active_points
        and the provided active_points list. Points with None values are skipped.

    Example:
        >>> points_in_houses = calculate_points_in_reciprocal_houses(
        ...     natal_chart, partner_chart, [AstrologicalPoint.SUN, AstrologicalPoint.MOON]
        ... )
        >>> sun_placement = points_in_houses[0]  # Assuming Sun is first
        >>> print(f"Sun falls in house: {sun_placement.projected_house_name}")
