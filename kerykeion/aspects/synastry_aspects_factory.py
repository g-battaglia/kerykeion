class SynastryAspectsFactory:
    """
    Factory class for creating synastry aspects analysis between two astrological subjects.

    This factory calculates all astrological aspects (angular relationships) between 
    planets and points in two different charts. It's primarily used for relationship 
    compatibility analysis, transit calculations, and comparative astrology.

    The factory provides both comprehensive aspect lists and filtered relevant aspects
    based on orb settings and chart axes considerations.

    Key Features:
        - Calculates all aspects between two subjects
        - Filters aspects based on orb thresholds
        - Applies stricter orb limits for chart axes (ASC, MC, DSC, IC)
        - Supports multiple subject types (natal, composite, planetary returns)

    Example:
        >>> john = AstrologicalSubjectFactory.from_birth_data("John", 1990, 1, 1, 12, 0, "London", "GB")
        >>> jane = AstrologicalSubjectFactory.from_birth_data("Jane", 1992, 6, 15, 14, 30, "Paris", "FR")
        >>> synastry = SynastryAspectsFactory.from_subjects(john, jane)
        >>> print(f"Found {len(synastry.relevant_aspects)} relevant aspects")
