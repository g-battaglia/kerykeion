Composite Subject Factory Module

This module provides functionality for creating composite astrological charts from two
individual astrological subjects. A composite chart represents the relationship between
two people by calculating midpoint positions between corresponding planetary placements
and house cusps.

The module implements the midpoint composite technique, which is the most commonly used
method for relationship astrology. This technique creates a single chart that symbolizes
the energy and dynamics of the relationship itself, rather than comparing individual charts.

Key Features:
- Midpoint calculation for all planetary positions
- Midpoint calculation for house cusp positions
- Proper handling of zodiacal boundary crossings (0°/360°)
- Validation of compatible astrological settings between subjects
- Lunar phase calculation for composite charts
- Support for all standard astrological points and house systems

Classes:
    CompositeSubjectFactory: Main factory class for creating composite charts

Dependencies:
    - AstrologicalSubjectFactory: For working with individual astrological subjects
    - Various kr_types modules: For type definitions and models
    - utilities module: For astrological calculations and helper functions

Example Usage:
    >>> from kerykeion import AstrologicalSubjectFactory, CompositeSubjectFactory
    >>> person1 = AstrologicalSubjectFactory.from_birth_data(...)
    >>> person2 = AstrologicalSubjectFactory.from_birth_data(...)
    >>> composite = CompositeSubjectFactory(person1, person2)
    >>> composite_chart = composite.get_midpoint_composite_subject_model()

    Factory class to create composite astrological charts from two astrological subjects.

    A composite chart represents the relationship between two people by calculating the midpoint
    between corresponding planetary positions and house cusps. This creates a single chart
    that symbolizes the energy of the relationship itself.

    Currently supports the midpoint method for composite chart calculation, where:
    - Planetary positions are calculated as the circular mean of corresponding planets
    - House cusps are calculated as the circular mean of corresponding houses
    - Houses are reordered to maintain consistency with the original house system
    - Only common active points between both subjects are included

    The resulting composite chart maintains the zodiac type, sidereal mode, houses system,
    and perspective type of the input subjects (which must be identical between subjects).
