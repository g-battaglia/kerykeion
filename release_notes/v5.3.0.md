# V5.3.0

## New Features

### AI Context Serializer

Introduced a new `context_serializer` module designed to bridge Kerykeion with AI and LLM applications. This feature provides a standardized way to convert astrological data into non-qualitative, factual text descriptions optimized for machine consumption.

-   **New `to_context()` function**: A universal entry point that accepts any Kerykeion Pydantic model and returns a structured string representation.
-   **Comprehensive Model Support**: Supports serialization for:
    -   Natal Charts (`AstrologicalSubjectModel`, `SingleChartDataModel`)
    -   Synastry Charts (`DualChartDataModel`)
    -   Transits (`TransitMomentModel`, `TransitsTimeRangeModel`)
    -   Composite Charts (`CompositeSubjectModel`)
    -   Solar/Lunar Returns (`PlanetReturnModel`)
    -   Individual components (Planets, Aspects, Lunar Phases, Element/Quality Distributions)
-   **AI-Optimized Output**: The output is designed to be injected directly into system prompts, providing LLMs with precise astrological data without hallucination risks.

#### Example Usage

```python
from kerykeion import AstrologicalSubjectFactory, to_context

subject = AstrologicalSubjectFactory.from_birth_data(
    "John Doe", 1990, 1, 1, 12, 0, "London", "GB"
)

# Get AI-ready context string
context = to_context(subject)
print(context)
```

Output:
