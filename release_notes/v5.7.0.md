-   **Synastry Aspects Translations**: Added translations for synastry aspects (#178).

## Technical Details

### Chart Drawer Refactoring

-   **Strategy Pattern**: The chart rendering logic now uses a Strategy Pattern, making it easier to add new chart types or modify existing ones without touching the core logic.
-   **Dataclasses & Type Aliases**: Introduced dataclasses and type aliases for better code organization and type safety.
-   **Reduced Duplication**: Significant code deduplication and improved documentation throughout the chart drawing module.
-   **Centralized Planet Configs**: Planet configurations have been moved to `config_constants.py` for centralized management.

### Code Quality Improvements

-   **Mypy Compliance**: All mypy type errors have been resolved across the entire `kerykeion` package.
-   **Pyright Configuration**: Added pyright configuration for additional type checking capabilities.
-   **Ruff Formatting**: The entire codebase has been formatted with ruff for consistent code style.
-   **Improved Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings in `charts_utils.py`, `draw_planets.py`, and other modules with section headers and clearer explanations.

### Bug Fixes

-   **South Lunar Node Calculation**: Fixed incorrect calculation of the south lunar node.
-   **Declination for Auto-Activated Points**: Corrected declination values for automatically activated celestial points.

### Testing

-   Added comprehensive SVG chart tests covering edge cases.
-   Improved test coverage for chart generation.
