# Release Notes v5.6.0

## Highlights

-   **Relationship Score Breakdown**: The `RelationshipScoreFactory` now provides full transparency into how the compatibility score is calculated. A new `score_breakdown` field in the results details exactly which astrological rules contributed points to the final score.

## Technical Details

-   **New Model**: Added `ScoreBreakdownItemModel` to `kerykeion.schemas` to structure the breakdown data.
-   **Updated Model**: `RelationshipScoreModel` now includes a `score_breakdown` list field.
-   **Scoring Transparency**: Each item in the breakdown includes:
    -   `rule`: The identifier of the scoring rule (e.g., `sun_moon_conjunction`, `destiny_sign`).
    -   `description`: A human-readable text explaining the contribution.
    -   `points`: The exact points awarded (+11, +8, +5, +4).
    -   `details`: Specific context like aspect names and orbital precision.

## Scoring Rules (Ciro Discepolo Method)

The breakdown reflects the following standard rules:

-   **Destiny Sign (+5)**: Sun signs share the same quality.
-   **Sun-Sun Major (+11/+8)**: Conjunction, opposition, square (precision weighted).
-   **Sun-Moon Conjunction (+11/+8)**: Weighted by orbital precision.
-   **Minor Aspects (+4)**: Sun-Sun (trine/sextile), Sun-Moon (non-conjunction), Sun/Moon-Ascendant, Venus-Mars.

## Examples

```python
from kerykeion import AstrologicalSubjectFactory
from kerykeion.relationship_score_factory import RelationshipScoreFactory

# ... setup subjects ...
factory = RelationshipScoreFactory(john, yoko)
score = factory.get_relationship_score()

# Access the breakdown
for item in score.score_breakdown:
    print(f"{item.points} pts: {item.description} [{item.details}]")

# Example JSON Output
