# What is an asteroid?
# --------------------
#
# Asteroids are small planets. Because there are too many
# of them and because most of them are quite small,
# astronomers did not like to call them "planets", but
# invented names like "asteroid" (Greek "star-like",
# because through telescopes they did not appear as planetary
# discs but as star-like points) or "planetoid" (Greek
# "similar to a planet"). However they are also often
# called minor planets.
# The minor planets can roughly be divided into two groups.
# There are the inner asteroids, the majority of which
# circles in the space between Mars and Jupiter, and
# there are the outer asteroids, which have their realm
# beyond Neptune. The first group consists of rather
# dense, earth-like material, whereas the Transneptunians
# mainly consist of water ice and frozen gases. Many comets
# are descendants of the "asteroids" (or should one say
# "comets"?) belt beyond Neptune. The first Transneptunian
# objects (except Pluto) were discovered only after 1992
# and none of them has been given a name as yet.
#
#
# The largest main belt asteroids
# -------------------------------
# Most asteroids are actually only debris of collisions
# of small planets that formed in the beginning of the
# solar system. Only the largest ones are still more
# or less complete and round planets.

1    Ceres        # 913 km  goddess of corn and harvest
2    Pallas       # 523 km  goddess of wisdom, war and liberal arts
4    Vesta        # 501 km  goddess of the hearth fire
10   Hygiea       # 429 km  goddess of health
511  Davida       # 324 km  after an astronomer David P. Todd
704  Interamnia   # 338 km  "between rivers", ancient name of
                  #         its discovery place Teramo
65   Cybele       # 308 km  Phrygian Goddess, = Rhea, wife of Kronos-Saturn
52   Europa       # 292 km  beautiful mortal woman, mother of Minos by Zeus
87   Sylvia       # 282 km
451  Patientia    # 280 km  patience
31   Euphrosyne   # 270 km  one of the three Graces, benevolence
15   Eunomia      # 260 km  one of the Hours, order and law
324  Bamberga     # 252 km  after a city in Bavaria
3    Juno         # 248 km  wife of Zeus
16   Psyche       # 248 km  "soul", name of a nymph


# Asteroid families
# -----------------
# Most asteroids live in families. There are several kinds
# of families.
# - There are families that are separated from each other
#   by orbital resonances with Jupiter or other major planets.
# - Other families, the so-called Hirayama families, are the
#   relics of asteroids that broke apart long ago when they
#   collided with other asteroids. They still share similar
#   orbital qualities.
# - Third, there are the Trojan asteroids that are caught
#   in regions 60 degrees ahead or behind a major planet
#   (Jupiter or Mars) by the combined gravitational forces
#   of this planet and the Sun.

# Near Earth groups:
# ------------------
#
# Aten family: they cross Earth; mean distance from Sun is less than Earth

2062 Aten         # an Egyptian Sun god
2100 Ra-Shalom    # Ra is an Egyptian Sun god, Shalom is Hebrew "peace"
                  # was discovered during Camp David mid-east peace conference

# Apollo family: they cross Earth; mean distance is greater than Earth

1862 Apollo       # Greek Sun god
1566 Icarus       # wanted to fly to the sky, fell into the ocean
                  # Icarus crosses Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
                  # and has his perihelion very close to the Sun
3200 Phaethon     # wanted to drive the solar chariot, crashed in flames
                  # Phaethon crosses Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
                  # and has his perihelion very close to the Sun
69230 Hermes      # Greek name of Mercury;
		  # discovered and lost in 1937, rediscovered in 2003

# Amor family: they cross Mars, approach Earth

1221 Amor         # Roman love god
433  Eros         # Greek love god
719  Albert       # dicovered and lost in 1911 rediscovered in 2000

# Mars Trojans:
# -------------

5261 Eureka       a mars Trojan

# Main belt families:
# -------------------

# Hungarias: an asteroid group at 1.95 AU

434  Hungaria     # after Hungary

# Floras: a Hirayama family at 2.2 AU

8    Flora        # goddess of flowers

# Phocaeas: an asteroid group at 2.36 AU

25   Phocaea      # maritime town in Ionia

# Koronis family: a Hirayama family at 2.88 AU

158  Koronis      # mother of Asklepios by Apollo

# Eos family: a Hirayama family at 3.02 AU

221  Eos          # goddess of dawn

# Themis family: a Hirayama family at 3.13 AU

24   Themis       # goddess of justice

# Hildas: an asteroid belt at 4.0 AU, in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# The Hildas have fairly eccentric orbits and, at their
# aphelion, are very close to the orbit of Jupiter. However,
# at those times, Jupiter is ALWAYS somewhere else. As
# Jupiter approaches, the Hilda asteroids move towards
# their perihelion points.

153  Hilda        # female first name, means "heroine"

# a single asteroid at 4.26 AU, in 4:3 resonance with Jupiter
279  Thule        # mythical center of Magic in the uttermost north

# Jupiter Trojans:
# ----------------
# Only the Trojans behind Jupiter are actually named after Trojan heroes,
# whereas the "Trojans" ahead of Jupiter are named after Greek heroes that
# participated in the Trojan war. However there have been made some mistakes,
# i.e. there are some Trojan "spies" in the Greek army and some Greek "spies"
# in the Trojan army.

# Greeks ahead of Jupiter:
624  Hector       # Trojan "spy" in the Greek army, by far the greatest
                  # Trojan hero and the greatest Trojan asteroid
588  Achilles     # slayer of Hector
1143 Odysseus

# Trojans behind Jupiter:
1172 �neas
3317 Paris
884  Priamus

# Jupiter-crossing asteroids:
# ---------------------------

3552 Don Quixote  # perihelion near Mars, aphelion beyond Jupiter;
                  # you know Don Quixote, don't you?

                  # after a Mexican national hero

                  # the man sitting below a sword suspended by a thread

# Centaurs:
# ---------

2060 Chiron       # perihelion near Saturn, aphelion near Uranus;
                  # also a member of the comets catalogue (95P Chiron)
		  # because it has cometary activity
                  # educator of heros, specialist in healing and war arts
5145 Pholus       # perihelion near Saturn, aphelion near Neptune
                  # seer of the gods, keeper of the wine of the Centaurs
7066 Nessus       # perihelion near Saturn, aphelion in Pluto's mean distance
                  # ferryman, killed by Hercules, kills Hercules


# Neptune Trojans:
# ----------------
# none named by Feb 2004

# Plutinos:
# ---------
# These are objects with periods similar to Pluto, i.e. objects
# that resonate with the Neptune period in a 3:2 ratio.
# There are no Plutinos included in Swiss Ephemeris so far, but
# PLUTO himself can be considered a Plutino type asteroid!

28978 Ixion       # 1060 km diameter
90482 Orcus       # 1700 km, largest Plutino by Oct 2005 (besides Pluto himself)

# Cubewanos:
# ----------
# These are non-Plutino objects with periods greater than Pluto.
# The word "Cubewano" is derived from the preliminary designation
# of the first-discovered Cubewano: 1992 QB1
# to be named after creation deities

15760 1992 QB1    # first-discovered Cubewano, 280 km diameter
20000 Varuna      # 980 km
50000 Quaoar      # largest Cubewano by Feb 2004: 1250 km

# Scattered-Disk Objects:
# ----------------------
# Highly eccentric trans-Neptunian orbits
90377 Sedna       # perihelion 76 = AU, aphelion = 913 AU, period = 11000 years
                  # diameter = 1700 km

# strange bodies
# --------------------
20461 Dioretsa	  # a retrograde asteroid at Period = 115 years (a=23.757)
                  # perihelion = 2.4 AU aphelion = 45 AU, incl = 160
		  # this is a rather comet-like orbit

3753 Cruithne     # also called a "second moon" of earth;
                  # actually not a moon, but an asteroid that
                  # orbits around the sun in a certain resonance
                  # with the earth.
                  # After the first Celtic group to come to the British Isles.

# Also try the two points 60 degrees in front of and behind the
# Moon, the so called Lagrange points, where the combined
# gravitational forces of the earth and the moon might imprison
# rocks and stones. There have been some photographic hints
# that there are clouds of such material around these points.
# They are called the Kordylewski clouds.
